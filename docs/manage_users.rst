Manage users
============

|image|

From the Manage users home screen you can Add a new user, search for
current users and edit user accounts.

11.1 Search for users

On selecting to open the manage users tab you are presented with a
search box and plus button. Typing in the search area will bring back
results from the users entered on the system - as with the other
searches on the system once three characters have been entered results
will begin to be returned.

|image|

The search runs across all three fields but, when searching for a user,
you will only retrieve and be able to maintain users that are the same
or below your current username login type.

For example, a user logged in with “Librarian” level user type will not
retrieve users with the type “Admin”.

11.2 Add a new user

Please note this section refers to the manual creation of users. For
customers using Shibboleth or LDAP user creation will be automated and
the password section of this chapter will not apply.

|image|\ Click on the plus button icon and the following form will be
opened

Required fields are: user name, login, email address and user type.

User type applies a default set of permissions for the user (see chapter
2)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+
| When a user has been added successfully the SUCCESS confirmation message will appear in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.   | |image|   |
+=======================================================================================================================================+===========+
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+

A password email is sent to the newly created user. From this screen,
when in edit mode, an administrator can also send a password reset
email.

11.3 Edit or Deactivate a user

|image|\ Edit or deactivate users by clicking on the appropriate link as
in the following example.

11.4 Managing user roles

|image|\ From the manage user page you can also edit list roles for a
specific user on a list by list basis - to access this select the edit
list roles icon.

This will result in the \`Manage User Roles window opening

|image|

From this manage user roles screen you can select one or more of the
five available roles that can be assigned to a user on both lists and
sub-lists.

|image|

User roles, in combination with user types, control the access and
permissions for users of the system.

Roles can be split into two types:

-  Those that allow you to manipulate the list in yellow

-  |image|\ Those that associate you with the list in blue

Hovering over the button will provide you with a brief functional
description and a display of the associated privileges (see Appendix B
for a glossary of all privileges).

+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| |image|   | The leader role visibly associates a user with a list. Searching by a user name will display the associated lists and the users name will display when viewing a list                                |
+===========+======================================================================================================================================================================================================+
| |image|   | The owner role associates a user with a list without making their name visible within that list.                                                                                                     |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| |image|   | The author role allows a user to fully maintain a list without moderation and grants full control of the contents of a list. Use of the author role removes the user from the moderation workflow.   |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| |image|   | The moderator role allows editing and publication of submitted lists. It is an intermediate role allowing for a drafting and validation phase prior to the publication of a list.                    |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| |image|   | The editor role allows a user to create and control the contents of a draft but does not allow final publication an editor instead submits changes for moderation.                                   |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Click on the buttons to set privileges.

When privileges have been set the buttons become indented: |image|

In the example above, Professor Faculty is given the leader role at the
the top level of the University of Rebus hierarchy. This means that he
will be visibly associated with all lists in that hierarchy as roles are
inherited.

The Professor has also been give the role of Moderator for the Faculty
of humanities. This means that in a moderation workflow he is able to
accept or reject drafts produced by editors of any of the sociology
lists. The editors in this case being the faculty academics.

|image|

Sarah Academic a Sociology Lecturer has been marked as leader and owner
of Sociology and has been marked as an editor for the whole of the
Faculty of Humanities.

In this case Sarah can create lists, add material to them and is
associated with them but she cannot publish them. Instead she is given
the option of submitting them for moderation. Professor Faculty can then
review them edit them and either publish or reject them.
