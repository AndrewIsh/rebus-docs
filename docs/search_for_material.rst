A search provides a summary of information about the material found.
Title, Author and ISBN are displayed alongside a column for Actions.

The Actions column allows users to view the lists that the
material is used in also, if they have the correct privileges, to edit
manually created material. The material's Global Tags can also be added
and removed from here.

the correct permissions and the material was manually added you can edit
it. When you have made your changes click finish. Changes are saved
across the system. You will then be returned to the Search Material

screen except it displays list on which the selected material is used.
