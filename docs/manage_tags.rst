Manage Tags
===========

Material tags are an additional way to group material using keywords,
they provide a useful tool for searching, browsing and filtering
enhancing the user experience. Tags can be created and applied using the
‘Manage Tags’ functionality or directly whilst editing lists.

Using the ‘Manage tags’ admin area means that you can edit a tag and the
changes you make will automatically apply to all occurrences of that tag
throughout your system.

10.1 Add a new tag and search

On selecting manage tags from the admin menu you will be presented with
two boxes - the first provides a text box that will allow you to create
a new tag. The second box displays the existing tags along with details
of how frequently they are used.

Once you add a new tag it will become available for other users to
select and apply to a reading list.

10.2 Finding, Editing and Deleting material tags

|image|\ Use the filter box to limit the tags displayed. In a similar
way to searching the filtered results will start to be displayed once
you have entered three characters. You are then able to either edit or
delete a tag.

10.3 Applying a tag to an item in a list

|image|\ Tags can also be added as you edit a list. When editing
Material begin typing in the tag area rebus:list will begin to give you
suggestions once you tag has passed three characters. You can select a
tag that has previously been created or you can create a tag that is
entirely new. Once a tag is created by this method it will be accessible
from the manage tags tab.
