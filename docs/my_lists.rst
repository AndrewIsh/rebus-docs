In the above example we can see My Lists for the Bertie user. Bertie has
been given a role of Author on the ‘Top 10 Books About Gardens’ list
only. That means that Bertie has an association with this list and it
will therefore be displayed.

The different columns are:

-  Name - Name of the list the user has an association with.

-  Course - Information from the Course field of the List metadata if it
   is populated

-  Items - Number of Items on the List.

-  Valid from - The date the list will first be available.

-  Valid to - The date the list will cease to be available.

-  Created - The date the list was first created.

-  Updated - The date the list was last modified.

-  Under moderation - In the moderation workflow this heading shows if
   there is a draft that has been submitted for moderation but not yet
   accepted or denied.

-  Suppressed - This displays if the list has been suppressed from
   public view.
